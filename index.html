<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:
115%'>A summary of the career of Rinus Michels, the best coach of all time
according to France Football.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%'>The
famous magazine, France Football, which is in charge of awarding the Ballon
d'Or, published a controversial ranking of the 50 best coaches who have passed
in the history of soccer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%'>The
magazine based its ranking on three criteria: Achievements, legacy, length of
career and impact.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%'>Topping
the ranking is Rinus Michels, the Dutch coach who started managing Ajax in
1965, a team that was close to relegation, and turned it into one of the best
in the world, even leading it to become European Champion in 1971. He also
coached FC Barcelona where he won the Laliga, the Copa del Rey and the Fairs
Champions Cup match. He coached the Netherlands national team, where he was
runner-up in the 1974 FIFA World Cup and champion of the 1988 European
Championship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%'>While
coach of Ajax he began to implement the invention for which he went down in history:
&quot;total soccer&quot;. Michels got the idea from Jack Reynolds, an
Englishman who was his coach while he was an Ajax player.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%'>This
idea of &quot;total soccer&quot; meant that every player could play in any
position. Thus, no defender, midfielder or striker remained in his starting
position during the match. The center forward (Johan Cruyff) could drop into
midfield or play as a winger. The midfielders played as defenders when the
opponent had the ball, and joined the attack when their team attacked. The
full-backs were constantly moving forward, playing as a winger. All this
combined with a pressure after loss that suffocated the opponent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%'>Rinus
Michels has been called the &quot;father of modern soccer&quot;, as many
tactics we see today in our soccer, such as &quot;tiki-taka&quot; or the
&quot;false 9&quot;, are tactics or style of play inherited from Michels'
&quot;total soccer&quot;.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%'>His
attacking soccer led him to the bench of FC Barcelona in 1971, thus beginning
the legendary relationship between soccer in the Netherlands and the Culé team.
Two years later, Johan Cruyff joined the team. In Spain he won a league title
in 1974.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%'>Just
in 1974 he simultaneously managed the Netherlands national team. He arrived
with the team qualified for the World Cup that year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%'>It
was with the national team, nicknamed the &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot;, that
Michels went down in history. He managed 10 matches, 9 of them undefeated,
losing only the final against Germany. Despite losing the final, Michels' team
enchanted the world with a style of play never seen before. Thus marking a before
and after in world soccer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%'>After
the World Cup, Rinus Michels began to make short-lived moves to the bench: he
returned to Ajax for one season, then returned to Barça in 1976 and won a Copa
del Rey in 1978.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%'>In
1984 he returned to the Dutch national team, where four years later he won the
only title in the team's history: the 1988 European Championship.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%'>In
1992 he coached the Netherlands at the European Championship, which was to be
his last coaching experience.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:115%'>He
continued to work as a member of the UEFA Technical Committee, but Rinus
Michels died at the age of 77 on March 3, 2005 in Aalst, Belgium, after
suffering from heart problems. Johan Cruyff would say at the time that
&quot;both as a player and as a coach, no one taught me as much as he did. I
always admired his leadership.</span></p>
